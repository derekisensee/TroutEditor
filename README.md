A Trout-themed Text Editor.

Java 8 is required.

*Build Instructions
If you're on Linux, you can simply "git clone https://github.com/falldj/TroutEditor.git" the repository, "cd" into the "src/" folder, and run the "./buildJar.sh" script. This will automatically create a .jar for your use, with the latest code revisions.

To update, update the repository with "git pull", then run the buildJar.sh again.

If you're on Windows, you can "javac *.java" in the src/ folder, then (from the root folder TroutEditor/) you can run "java src.Driver"
